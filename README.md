# WeirdoAlert
This telegram bot allows for a verification process of all users in order to ban weirdos that spam NSFW content
(This bot will be available also for Discord, give me time.
## Dependencies
Install the NuGet package [Telegram.Bot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Telegram.Bot/) and all the dependencies should be installed.
### Compatibility
Since this project is made in .NET Core and not in .NET Framework, it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux although i don't reccommend the first two because Linux is better for servers
